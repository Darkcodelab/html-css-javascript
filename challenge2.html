    <p style="background-color: lightblue;"> <b>Albert Einstein</b> was a <ins>German-born</ins> theoretical physicist who developed the <mark>theory of relativity</mark>, one of the two pillars of modern physics </p>



    <q style="background-color: lightgray; font-family: Verdana;">If you can't explain it simply, you don't understand it well enough. - Albert Einstein

    <p style="background-color: lightgreen;">By 1908, he was recognized as a leading scientist and was appointed lecturer at the <cite>University of Bern</cite></p>



    <p style="background-color: pink;">
        Einstein received numerous awards and honors, and in 1922, he was awarded the <mark>1921 Nobel Prize in Physics "for his services to Theoretical Physics</mark>, and especially for his discovery of the law of the photoelectric effect". None of the nominations in 1921 met the criteria set by <cite>Alfred Nobel</cite>, so the 1921 prize was carried forward and awarded to <b>Einstein</b> in 1922.
