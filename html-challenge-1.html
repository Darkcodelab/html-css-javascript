    <h1>Water</h1>
    <h4>From wikipedia.</h4>
    
    <p>Water is a <em>transparent, tasteless, odorless, and nearly colorless chemical substance</em>, which is the main constituent of Earth's streams, lakes, and oceans, and the fluids of most living organisms. It is vital for all known <b>forms of life</b>, even though it provides no calories or organic nutrients. Its chemical formula is H<sub>2</sub>O, meaning that each of its molecules contains <u>one oxygen</u> and <u>two hydrogen atoms</u>, connected by covalent bonds. Water is the name of the liquid state of H<sub>2</sub>O at standard ambient temperature and pressure. It forms precipitation in the form of rain and aerosols in the form of fog. <b>Clouds</b> are formed from suspended droplets of <i>water and ice</i>, its solid state. When finely divided, crystalline ice may precipitate in the form of snow. The gaseous state of water is <b>steam or water vapor</b>. Water moves continually through the water cycle of evaporation, transpiration (evapotranspiration), condensation, precipitation, and runoff, usually reaching the sea.</p>
